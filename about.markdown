Name is António, I know, it’s nothing special, I have a bachelor in Arts and Multimedia and overflowing curiosity and the will to learn.

After finishing my studies due to pressure to find a job I still haven’t had the chance to work in a field I enjoy, like Web Dev or Game Dev, but instead the couple of years that succeeded I have jumped around a few companies creating an unplanned career in logistics, starting in a hardware store warehouse to OR logistics manager in a private hospital and after in an electronics and computer store, the later actually paid better, there where a few more short seasonal jobs in between and before.

The reason I never stayed put and allowed myself to grow within those companies, is that I always ended up growing bored and around 8 to 9 months I ended up quitting and searching for another thing.

So recently, after realizing that I was developing depression tied to feeling unaccomplished professionally I decided to start investing in my personal goals. But this was the worst year to get my life together.

This little site is the first step to pursue a new career, helping remember stuff I forgot with time like HTML and CSS, but also to learn new things like liquid design and static web sites, be aware that this place is an experimenting sandbox besides being my weird blog / portfolio, so weird stuff might show up from time to time.

From now on besides developing my web skill, I want to get back to creative coding and doing little neat animation projects in 2D, 3D or Stop Motion, those were little neat hobbies I stopped doing for no reason, and start learning a programming language, not sure which yet.
I may be asking a lot from myself but I like to say:

> Give me enough coffee and all is possible.
